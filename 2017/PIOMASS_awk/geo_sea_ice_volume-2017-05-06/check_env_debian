	It does work, it may need gnuplot5 and awk or gawk
	But it now works with gnuplot 4.6 patchlevel 6 on debian
	Maybe I moved the dependency, or maybe it got patched ?

	You may neet to edit #!/usr/bin/gawk -f
	Because #!/usr/bin/env gawk -f
	might have too many parameters
	Ignore this script

	Tcl is also used for an extra function,
	where the date is converted to human readable
	showing th latest date of data
	and printing peaks found
	so you dont need it, but any version should work
