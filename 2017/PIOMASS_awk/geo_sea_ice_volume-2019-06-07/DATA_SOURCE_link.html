	Follow this link, 
	their page has 2 similar forms on one screen,
	asking for your name / email /organisation.

	The first is for the DAY data,
	the second is for the MONTH data (ignore that, make your own).

	Tell them your name or leave it blank, and 
	Ignore the confusing words immediately following it, 
	they are missing a separation line, or new heading,
	and using a JavaScript enabled browser,
	click on the first SEND button,

	That then says ... Thanks ... and just below that it now says:
	Download data by clicking link to the right: Daily Ice Volume Data
	Click on that and be happy
