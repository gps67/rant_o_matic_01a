	OK your plot worked and you have the graph.

	The X-axis is year.

	  The data is converted to fractions of a year.
	  There is a Tcl script to do the opposite,
	  but remember that 0.01 of a year is 1/100 not 1/365

	  The data starts in 1979, with the satellite.
	  We can only guess that there is more loss before then
	  My guess is a gradual incline down from 22/30/38 or higher

	  I plot a blank bit to the left and to the right,
	  so that you can extrapolate yourself.

	  My guess is a day of no ice before 2030,
	  and no day of ice after 2070

	The Y-axis is in units of 1000 km3

	The Y=zero line is visible.
	  You may be used to dramatic looking graphs
	  which show some variable changing (dramatically)
	  from 123.4 to 120.4, without any zoom out context.

	The zero line is absolute.
	  You cant measure negative ice (warm water)
	  as the annual cycle dips below the zero horizon,
	  there will be strange clipping effects,
	  and a misleading distortion.

	The green line is like a sin wave,
	  tracking the daily ice volume,
	  as computed by the PIOMAS project (and others).
	  It is the raw input data, at the graphs pixel res.

	Above the avg365 line, and below, are the extents
	  of the Arctic winter and summer. +8 and -8 (ish)
	  This seems to have remained consistent.
	  It represents - it is - the amount of ice, each year,
	  which is processing heat. Absorbing heat by melting,
	  releasing heat by freezing.

	The 365 day average looks stable,
	  I think it is a good indicator of what is going on.
	  Look for the file tmp/tmp_plot_data_avg2.data.tmp

 1979.503 25.387
 ... one line per day ...
 2017.166 12.6302

	  That is telling you that over 4 decades
	  the ice has dropped from 25.4 to 12.6 ie a half
	  Find those points on the visual graph,
	  and decide if they are fairly representative.

	The gawk script detects the annual min and max,
	and plots them with yellow and purple lines.
	A lot of graphs focus on the MIN hitting zero

	Arctic is one place only.
	  It does not include mountain tops.
	  nor Greenland,
	  nor Ant-Arctica

	Arctic is a sea surrounded by land,
	  or openings or channels.
	  Ice might be blown against shore channels,
	  Storms might scatter or gather ice
	  you need to look at map visualisations
	  The pole is approximately the centre of the ice area.

	Away from pole is already zero.
	  The general obsession with graph lines hitting zero
	  may distract from the fact that away from the pole
	  the radius of the remaining ice is retreating
	  and there is already many days of great distance
	  of water from ice (ie it is not 1 day 5 meters away)

	Shallow sea shelf - and methane release
	  Ocean floor permafrost, holds a lot of methane
	  Maybe the wind is blowing ice to that shore
	  Maybe the water is absorbing escaping methane
	  Maybe the problem is still a risk.
	  (other studies say there is not much released to atmos)
	  Methane is over 101x as strong as CO2
	  but it half oxidises after a decade
	  leaving the 1x CO2 which remains for 1000 years
	  Many report it as 27x but this is wrong,
	  as that depends on the future oxidation
	  and ignores what it is doing this year, now


	Melting ice = 80'C

	 334 joules per gram is latent heat of fusion of water
	 4.184 joules per gram is specific heat if water
	 water = water - ignoring salt

	 334 / 4.184 = 79.83

	 so melting ice absorbs 80'C of water heat

	 So when the sunshine gives 334 joules, it melts 1g of ice
	 the same sunshine without ice would raise 1g by 80'C
	 or raise 10g by 8'C
	 This is why global warming, is heating not warming

	 but what happens when the ice is not there to absorb the heat?
	 the water gets warmer
	 the air gets warmer
	 the deeper water gets warmer
	 the surrounding ice melts faster
	 more energy is radiated as IR back to space (phew)
	 most moves from over there to over here (aaghh)

	 Away from any remaining ice, the negative ice is warm water
	 That will hold enough heat to stop the ice forming
	 So it is still processing some summer heat
	 but the same trend line will move into more -ve ice
	 but with more added dissipation
	 so the rest of the planet will experience extra heat in summer
